# EIP Assignment 6
- This is the CycleGAN implemented in keras (with TF 2.0 beta) from the original paper for face ageing.
- The perfect way to enable the CycleGAN to learn a disentangled relationship between features withot the latent space was well documented in the paper: Attribute-Guided Face Generation Using Conditional CycleGAN by Yongyi Yu et al. I spent a good deal of time on the implementation as the author's didn't make it public [[Paper]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.09966v2.pdf)
